Bullshido - A Multiplayer Fighting Game for Discord
Overview:

The game determines which player goes first based on their training level. Players then take turns attacking each other.
Each attack deals a random amount of damage, influenced by the player’s chosen fighting style and stats, as well as the stats of the defender.
The combat actions are described in a humanized manner, e.g., "Player1 throws a punch into Player2's body causing 15 damage!"

Winning the Game:

The game continues for 3 rounds, with each player taking turns attacking and defending. Each round is scored separately. The player with the most points at the end of the 3 rounds wins the fight. Alternatively, a player can win by knocking out their opponent before the end of the 3 rounds. Knockouts can occur by TKO or KO. 


## Levelling System Explained

### Stamina Calculation

**Formula:**


`self.player1_stamina = self.player1_data.get('stamina_level', 100) + (self.player1_data.get('stamina_bonus', 0) * 5)
self.player2_stamina = self.player2_data.get('stamina_level', 100) + (self.player2_data.get('stamina_bonus', 0) * 5)` 

**Explanation:**

-   `stamina_level`: The base stamina level of the player, defaulting to 100.
-   `stamina_bonus`: Each point allocated to stamina increases it by a fixed amount (5 in this case).

**Impact:**

-   The total stamina for each player is the sum of their base stamina level and the bonus from their stamina stat points.
-   **Example:** If a player has a `stamina_level` of 100 and a `stamina_bonus` of 2, their total stamina would be `100 + (2 * 5) = 110`.

### Health Calculation

**Formula:**

`self.player1_health = 100 + (self.player1_data.get('health_bonus', 0) * 10)
self.player2_health = 100 + (self.player2_data.get('health_bonus', 0) * 10)` 

**Explanation:**

-   Each point allocated to health increases the player's health by a fixed amount (10 in this case).

**Impact:**

-   The total health for each player is the sum of a base health level (100) and the bonus from their health stat points.
-   **Example:** If a player has a `health_bonus` of 3, their total health would be `100 + (3 * 10) = 130`.

### Damage Calculation

**Formula:**

`def calculate_adjusted_damage(self, base_damage, training_level, diet_level, damage_bonus):
    training_bonus = math.log10(training_level + 1) * self.training_weight
    diet_bonus = math.log10(diet_level + 1) * self.diet_weight
    adjusted_damage = base_damage * (1 + training_bonus + diet_bonus + (damage_bonus * 0.05))
    return round(adjusted_damage)` 

**Explanation:**

-   `base_damage`: The base amount of damage dealt by a strike.
-   `training_bonus`: A multiplier based on the player's training level, contributing to the overall damage.
-   `diet_bonus`: A multiplier based on the player's diet level, contributing to the overall damage.
-   `damage_bonus`: Each point allocated to damage increases the base damage by a percentage (5% per point in this case).

**Impact:**

-   The total damage dealt by a player in a strike is influenced by their base damage, training level, diet level, and damage stat points.
-   **Example:** If a player's `base_damage` is 20, `training_level` is 2, `diet_level` is 3, and `damage_bonus` is 4:
    -   `training_bonus = math.log10(2 + 1) * 0.15 ≈ 0.071`
    -   `diet_bonus = math.log10(3 + 1) * 0.15 ≈ 0.09`
    -   `damage_bonus = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20`
    -   `adjusted_damage = 20 * (1 + 0.071 + 0.09 + 0.20) ≈ 20 * 1.361 = 27.22`
    -   The final damage would be `round(27.22) = 27`.

### Summary

1.  **Stamina**: The player's stamina determines how many actions they can perform before getting tired. Each point in stamina increases the total stamina by 5 units.
2.  **Health**: The player's health determines how much damage they can take before losing. Each point in health increases the total health by 10 units.
3.  **Damage**: The player's damage output in strikes is influenced by their training level, diet level, and damage points. Each point in damage increases the base damage by 5%.
