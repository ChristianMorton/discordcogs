Based on your requirements, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `Player`: This class will represent a player in the game. It will have attributes such as `name`, `fighting_style`, `strength`, `agility`, `stamina`, `conditioning`, and `health`. It will also have methods to train stats, learn a fighting style, and attack.

2. `Fight`: This class will represent a fight between two players. It will have methods to start the fight, execute turns, and determine the winner.

3. `Bullshido`: This class will be the main class for the game. It will have methods to add players, challenge players, and manage fights.

4. `BullshidoCog`: This class will be the cog for the Red-Discord bot. It will handle commands from users and interact with the `Bullshido` class to manage the game.

Now, let's start with the entrypoint file, `bullshido_cog.py`.
